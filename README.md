#### Summary
This repository is holding experiments related to my M.Tech thesis. <br>
This project is aiming to address the road extraction problem in end-to-end fashion. Our dataset is a set of aerial images taken from UAV(drones) from local areas within the NIT Rourkela campus. Throughout the experiments, we are benchmarking different state-of-the-art models and taking advantages to address our problem. The main objective of this project is to build an effective CNN model, being able to distinguish roads from occlusion and background
and able to generalize to later extension as well as to build our own dataset. 

> **Please note:** the development is undergoing and details will gradually be provided below.
